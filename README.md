## ABOUT

This is the first part of the AirBnB project. For this part, the main focus will be on creating models and the interpreter.

The interpreter basically helps to manage the objects of our AirBnB project. These include but not limited to:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place) Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc) Update attributes of an object Destroy an object
